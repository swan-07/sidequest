# SideQuest

For Hacknight (a hackathon a few weeks ago) my group won with SideQuest, a Google Extension. You can download it here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sidequest/lndafcnkmnkbjdoijfnceebpaejmhhdp

This is the main branch on the repo.


I made a nerd version of it with more minigames that are like "do this math problem" and less like "here's a fun captcha!".
I won't be publishing this version to the web store (since I don't think most people would prefer doing math problems over fun captchas) but I've created a branch for it on the GitHub (accessible here:
https://github.com/swan-07/sidequest/tree/nerd-version) and it's surprisingly easy to get an unpublished version of a Google Extension up and running on your computer!


Here are the steps:
1. Download the directory with all the code
2. Inside you'll find a folder called "extension". Zip that folder.
3. Go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode (on the top right)
4. On the top left click "Load unpacked" and drop in your zipped folder
5. You'll see your new extension pop up! Make sure it's activated, you can pin it, and you're done! Have fun playing around with it :D
